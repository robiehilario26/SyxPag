In 2010, Aleem Said, being a peace advocator for more than a decade, has successfully convened the Philippines Interfaith Leaders Forum; an innovative step he perceived as an interfaith initiative expert, during his tenure as member of the board of directors at Peacemakers' Circle Foundation. The Peacemakers? Circle was founded in July 1998 by Marites Guingona-Africa, niece of former Philippines Vice-President Teofisto Guingona.[citation needed] He is actively involved in interfaith dialogue, whether in private or public sector. He's quoted saying ?our collective prayers are the best thing that we can do as a nation to bolster the diplomatic efforts and representation of our government before the Government of China to save the lives of the three Filipinos,? as a response to the President's appeal during the wake of the conviction of jailed workers. Aleem Said also served as spiritual consultant during the recent National Forum on Zakat held at the SMX Convention Center. Paying zakat is one of Five Pillars of Islam. He explains that Quran has named the eight kinds of persons who should receive zakah, such as the Masako (destitute); fuqaraa (the needy or poor); amil' Zakah (the alms collectors); VI sabi `Tillah (in the path of God); gharimun (people burdened with debt); ibn as-Sabi l (the wayfarers); Riyadh (people in bondage or slavery); and mu'Allaf (those who have inclined towards Islam).He also gives spiritual guidance on every before, during, and after of the two Eids. In Ramadan, he cited the importance of adhering to the Sunnah of Islam's prophet. He also emphasized that Eid?l Fitr was also a day for visiting relatives and friends and for making reconciliation. In Dhu al-Hijjah, Aleem Said explained that Eid al-Adha symbolizes to the obedience of Prophet Ibrahim and his son Ismail as commanded by Allah, it represents the prayer for peace not only among Muslims but in unity and love of mankind that worship God. The eid means festival and adha means sacrifice.</em>
